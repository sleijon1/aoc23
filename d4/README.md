# Insights

I utilized an insight from d3 in using sets and then simple recursion for p2. The memoization isnt needed for p2 since runtime was <2s but why not make it go faster :wink:. Realized recursion wasnt actually needed for p2 either after looking at other solutions but since I was pretty happy with my own decided not to create an improved version.
