# AOC 23

Will try to take at least one solution from someone else each day to learn a new perspective, ill give credits in those to distinguish my own solutions from "inspired" ones. Also documenting insights from each day to recap and get more out of it than simply getting to a solution for a particular problem. My own solutions which I wont be cleaning up after getting 2* are named `original.py` or `_improve{x}.py`.
