# AOC 23

Will try to take at least one solution from someone else each day to learn a new perspective. Also documenting insights from each day to recap and get more out of it than simply getting to a solution for a particular problem. My own solutions which wont be cleaned up after getting 2* are named `original.py` or `_improve{x}.py`. If inspiration has been taken from someone elses solution credits are given in the code.
